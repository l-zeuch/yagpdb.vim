# YAGPDB Custom Commands Vim plugin

Syntax highlighting for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz) custom commands in (N)Vim.

[![CI](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Installing

### Manually

To install without any external plugin-manager dependencies, simply download the `Makefile` and run `make install`. For a
different destination, invoke `make` with `DESTDIR=/path/to/destination`.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim/master/Makefile && make install
```

> **Note**
> If you wish to install this for your Vim, but also have Neovim installed, make sure to invoke the `install-vim` target
> instead.

### With a Plugin Manager

> **Note**
> Installing with a plugin manager is recommended for Windows installations.

Use your favorite plugin manager to install this plugin. [tpope/vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
[VundleVim/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
and [Shougo/dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) are some of the more popular ones.
A lengthy discussion of these and other managers can be found on
[vi.stackexchange.com](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/388/what-is-the-difference-between-the-vim-plugin-managers).
Basic instructions are provided below, but please **be sure to read, understand, and follow all the safety rules that
come with your ~~power tools~~ plugin manager.**

<details>
<summary>Pathogen</summary>
Pathogen is more of a runtime path manager than a plugin manager. You must clone the plugins' repositories yourself to
a specific location, and Pathogen makes sure they are available in Vim.

1. In the terminal,

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/yagpdb.vim
    ```

1. In your `vimrc`,

    ```vim
    call pathogen#infect()
    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on
    ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Vundle</summary>

1. Install Vundle, according to its instructions.
1. Add the following text to your `vimrc`.

    ```vim
    call vundle#begin()
      Plugin 'l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim'
    call vundle#end()
    ```

1. Restart Vim, and run the `:PluginInstall` statement to install your plugins.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Vim-Plug</summary>

1. Install Vim-Plug, according to its instructions.
1. Add the following text to your `vimrc`.

    ```vim
    call plug#begin()
      Plug 'l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim'
    call plug#end()
    ```

1. Restart Vim, and run the `:PlugInstall` statement to install your plugins.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Dein</summary>

1. Install Dein, according to its instructions.
1. Add the following text to your `vimrc`.

    ```vim
    call dein#begin()
      call dein#add('l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim')
    call dein#end()
    ```

1. Restart Vim, and run the `:call dein#install()` statement to install your plugins.

## Configuration

### Clipboard

If you prefer to insert text on a middle click with your mouse instead of <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd>, change the register
used as follows:

```vim
let g:yagpdbcc_use_primary = 1
```

### Code Completion (Neovim >0.5 ONLY)

We provide bundled sources for code-completion to be used with [hrsh7th/nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp).
Follow the installation instructions there and enable the source as follows:

```lua
sources = cmp.config.sources({
    ...
    { name = 'yagpdb-cc' },
    ...
})
```

### Supported File Extensions

We support the following list of file extensions:

- `*.yag`
- `*.yagcc`
- `*.tmpl` <sup>1)</sup>
- `*.go.tmpl` <sup>1)</sup>

<sup>1)</sup> These extensions are not detected by default, as they are already used by Go. Please see below for
instructions on how to enable them.

### Overriding Filetypes

Sometimes, you may wish to use a file extension already in use by another language, such as `*.gotmpl`. Enable also
detecting those extension as follows, if needed:

```vim
let g:yagpdbcc_override_ft = 1
```

### Snippet Engines

We provide snippets for two distinct engines: [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips),
and [Neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim).

Select which one to use by setting the `g:yagpdbcc_snippet_engine` variable to either `ultisnips`, or `neosnippet`,
like so:

```vim
let g:yagpdbcc_snippet_engine = "ultisnips"
```

### Language Server Protocol

An LSP implementation can be found at <https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp>. You'll have to install it from source and
make it available in your `$PATH`; an installation of Rust is required. In the cloned repository, move to
`crates/yag-template-lsp` and run `cargo install --path .` to install the LSP. Make sure that whichever location cargo
installs to is in your `$PATH`.

As Neovim provides excellent inbuilt LSP support, we'll provide you with a sample configuration based on the [nvim-lspconfig]
plugin; this can go anywhere in your `init.lua`.

```lua
local lsp = require("lspconfig")
local configs = require("lspconfig.configs")
if not configs.yag_template_lsp then
  configs.yag_template_lsp = {
    default_config = {
      cmd = { "yag-template-lsp" },
      filetypes = { "yagpdbcc" },
      settings = {},
      single_file_support = true,
     },
  }
end
lsp.yag_template_lsp.setup{}
```

### (Re-)Generating Syntax Files

We aim to provide up-to-date function syntax highlighting based on the official instance of YAGPDB located at
[botlabs-gg/yagpdb](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb). Should you use a fork or otherwise modified version, and wish to
generate the highlighting for that repository, modify the [Makefile](Makefile) such that the call to `.bundle/lytfs` in the
`syntax:` recipe reads as follows

```make
syntax: .bundle/lytfs
    .bundle/lytfs owner/repo@branch > syntax/funcs
# [...]
```

Where `owner/repo` is the repository you wish to generate the syntax for, and `branch` is the branch you wish to use. A
current Python 3 installation is required.

After your modification, run `make generate` to update syntax definitions and the completion source file.

> [!WARNING]
> The [`lytfs` tool][lytfs] is potentially fragile â€” it makes assumptions about the file structure of the project.
> Make sure to read the source code of the tool before using it and verify compatibility with your version of YAGPDB.
