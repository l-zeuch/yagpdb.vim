==============================================================================
1. Intro						      *yagpdbcc-intro*

YAGPDB custom command support for Vim and Neovim. yagpdb.vim comes with rich
syntax highlighting specifically tailored to the YAGPDB custom command
language, code completion via `nvim-cmp`, and quality of life commands.


==============================================================================
2. Install						    *yagpdbcc-install*

yagpdb.vim requires at least Vim 8.2, or Neovim 0.5.

Currently it is safe to use the master branch for a stable experience.

In future, we might switch to tagged releases, or maybe not. Be sure to follow
the repository's activity somewhat closely.

yagpdb.vim follows the standard runtime path structure and should work with
any of the major plugin managers.

MANUALLY

For Pathogen or Vim |packages|, just clone the repo. For your convenience, we
provide an automagic installation which you can run. Simply download the
Makefile and execute the `install` target.
That way, you will have a Vim 8 packages compatible installation.
>
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim/master/Makefile
    $ make install
<
If you have both Neovim and Vim installed, but wish to install this preferably
for Vim, make sure to use the `install-vim` target instead.

WITH A PLUGIN MANAGER

Use your favourite plugin manager to install this plugin. tpope/vim-pathogen,
VundleVim/Vundle.vim, junegunn/vim-plug, and Shougo/dein.vim are some of the
more popular ones.

A lenghty discussion of these and other managers can be found on
vi.stackexchange:
https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/388/what-is-the-difference-between-the-vim-plugin-managers

Basic instructions are provided below, but please be sure to read, understand,
and follow all the safety rules that come with your power tools.

Pathogen~

(https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

Pathogen is more of a runtime path manager than a plugin manager.
You must clone the plugins' repositories yourself to a specific location,
and Pathogen makes sure they are available in Vim.

In the terminal:
>
    git clone https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim.git \
	~/.vim/bundle/yagpdb.vim
<
In your |vimrc|:
>
    call pathogen#infect()
    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on
<

Vundle~

(https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

Install Vundle, according to its instructions. Afterwards, add the following
text to your |vimrc|:
>
    call vundle#begin()
	Plugin 'l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim'
    call vundle#end()
<
Restart Vim, and run :PluginInstall to install your plugins.

Vim-Plug~

(https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

Install Vim-Plug, according to its instructions. Afterwards, add the following
text to your |vimrc|:
>
    call plug#begin()
	Plug 'l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim'
    call plug#end()
<
Restart Vim and run the :PlugInstall statement to install your plugins.

Dein~

(https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

Install Dein, according to its instructions. Afterwards, add the following
text to your |vimrc|:
>
    call dein#begin()
	call dein#add('l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim')
    call dein#end()
<
Restart Vim and run the :call dein#install() statement to install your
plugins.

==============================================================================
3. Configuration					     *yagpdbcc-config*

CLIPBOARD						*g:yagpdbcc_use_primary*

If you prefer to insert text with the middle mouse button instead of Ctrl V,
change to the PRIMARY register as follows:
>
    let g:yagpdbcc_use_primary = 1
<
CODE COMPLETION

Requires Neovim 0.5 or higher, see |Lua|.

We provided bundled sources for code-completion to be used with
hrsh7th/nvim-cmp. Follow the installation instructions there and enable the
source as follows:
>
    sources = cmp.config.sources({
	-- ...
	{ name = 'yagpdb-cc' },
	-- ...
    })
<
OVERRIDING FILETYPES					*g:yagpdbcc_override_ft*

Sometimes, you may with to use a file extension already in use by another
language, such as `*.gotmpl`. If that is the case, also select those
extensions as follows:
>
    let g:yagpdbcc_override_ft = 1
<
SNIPPET ENGINES					    *g:yagpdbcc_snippet_engine*

We provide snippets for two distinct engines: SirVer/UltiSnips, and
Shogo/neosnippet.vim.

Select which one to use by setting the |g:yagpdbcc_snippet_engine| variable to
either "ultisnips", or "neosnippet, like so:
>
    let g:yagpdbcc_snippet_engine = "ultisnips"
<
==============================================================================
4. Commands						   *yagpdbcc-commands*

								    *:YagCopy*
:YagCopy
    YagCopy copies the current buffer's content to your clipboard to paste
    into the YAGPDB control panel.

==============================================================================
5. Functions					          *yagpdbcc-functions*

Currently, there are no functions available outside of internal use.

==============================================================================
6. Syntax Highlighting		          *ft-yagpdbcc-syntax* *yagpdbcc-syntax*

yagpdb.vim comes with a fully custom syntax highlighting. It is aimed to be
easily expandable. Finally, it makes use of the inbuilt |highlight-groups|,
but links clusters and groups together in internal groups prefaced with `Yag`.

If you want to add your own new functions and/or keywords, because you're
running a modified version of YAGPDB, or just want to play around, add them to
the appropriate file located under `syntax/`.

Afterwards, to refresh the completion source, run the `generate` target via
`make`, if desired.

We recommend you read the currently existing syntax definitions carefully
before expanding them with your own.

LANGUAGE SERVER PROTOCOL                                          *yagpdbcc-lsp*

An LSP implementation can be found at https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp.
You'll have to install it from source and make it available in your $PATH; an
installation of Rust is required. In the cloned repository, move to
`crates/yag-template-lsp` and run `cargo install --path .` to install the LSP.
Make sure that whichever location cargo installs to is in your $PATH.

As Neovim provides excellent inbuilt LSP support, we'll provide you with a
sample configuration based on the nvim-lspconfig plugin; this can go anywhere
in your |init.lua|.
>
    local lsp = require("lspconfig")
    local configs = require("lspconfig.configs")
    if not configs.yag_template_lsp then
        configs.yag_template_lsp = {
            default_config = {
                cmd = { "yag-template-lsp" },
                filetypes = { "yagpdbcc" },
                settings = {},
                single_file_support = true,
            },
        }
    end
    lsp.yag_template_lsp.setup{}
<
RE-GENERATING SYNTAX FILES                                   *yagpdbcc-generate*

We aim to provide up-to-date function syntax highlighting based on the
official instance of YAGPDB located at https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb.
Should you use a fork or otherwise modified version, and wish to generate the
highlighting for that repository, modify the Makefile such that the call to
`.bundle/lytfs` in the `syntax:` recipe reads as follows
>
    syntax: .bundle/lytfs
        .bundle/lytfs owner/repo@branch > syntax/funcs
<

Where `owner/repo` is the repository you wish to generate the syntax for, and
`branch` is the branch you wish to use. A current Python 3 installation is
required.

After your modification, run `make generate` to update syntax definitions and
the completion source file.

Beware that the `lytfs` tool is potentially fragile â€” it makes assumptions
about the file structure of the project. Make sure to read the source code of
the tool before using it and verify compatibility with your version of YAGPDB.

==============================================================================
7. Development						*yagpdbcc-development*


TESTING

yagpdb.vim uses test files written with the vader.vim testing framework. It is
declarative, thus making it quite easy to write new test-cases.

As of now, we have little to no code-coverage and only test parts of the
syntax highlighting and pattern matching.

The full test suite is run via the `make test` target, but individual targets
for Vim and Neovim respectively are available as well.

CONTRIBUTING

All development finds place on the GitHub repository l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim.
Before submitting a patch, be sure to read CONTRIBUTING.md for a full guide.
